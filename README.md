# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

In this module we will learn about the data pipeline process know as Extract, Transform, and Load or ETL, a core concept in data engineering.
For this challenge, the Amazing Prime Video team would like to develop an agorithim that predicts which low budget movie being released becomes popular so that they can buy the streaming rights at a bargin. The two data sources provided are Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 and rating data from Movieland's website. The data will be extracted from the two data sources, transform it into one clean dataset and then load that data set into SQL table.

## Objective

- Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
- Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
- Clean and transform data using Pandas.
- Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
- Load data with PostgreSQL.

## Resources

- Data Source: wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv
- Database: movie_data
- Software: pgAdmin 4.13, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda
